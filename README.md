## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [AriaKit](https://ariakit.org/)

### What I learned

#### AriaKit

Really awesome unstyled component library to simplify accessibility

#### Custom Hooks

It was always a very enjoyable part of React since hooks were introduced.
This time i used it to handle the localstorage logic of the app.
Here is the code:

```ts
const LOCAL_PREFIX = 'dictionary-web-app';

const useLocalStorage = <T>(key: string, initialValue: T) => {
  const localKey = `${LOCAL_PREFIX}.${key}`;
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState<T>(() => {
    try {
      const localValue = window.localStorage.getItem(localKey);
      return localValue ? JSON.parse(localValue) : initialValue;
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return initialValue;
    }
  });

  React.useEffect(() => {
    window.localStorage.setItem(localKey, JSON.stringify(value));
  }, [localKey, value]);

  return [value, setValue] as const;
};
```
